# Klein
Modelling a Klein bottle, to be 3D printed. Java code which outputs openscad code which exports the .stl

The final version I ended up 3D Printing is New4.java. It writes openscad code to the file output.scad, which can then be built in openscad and exported as a .stl. I actually liked the organic look of the Net5 output better, but had trouble with holes and triangle winding.
