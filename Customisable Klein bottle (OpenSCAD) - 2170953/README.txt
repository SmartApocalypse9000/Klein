Customisable Klein bottle (OpenSCAD) by gaellafond on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2170953

Summary:
I saw this (quite old) challenge online:https://www.makerbot.com/media-center/2011/10/11/openscad-challenge-klein-bottleI could not resist making my own! I'm perfectionist, I made it as perfect as I could.I made it using bezier curves because that was a lot easier than trying to model the shape by removing "donnut" shapes around it (I could not see a neat solution to do this). Since there is no bezier functionality in OpenSCAD, I had to create my own, from an existing library found on thingiverse.The bottle is easy to customise. I added 4 variables at the beginning of the files:wallThicknessbottleHeightbottleDiametertubeDiameterThe "precision" (number of polygons generated) is also configurable. I set it to 180 to generate the STL files. I might have exaggerated, the STL files are quite large!I also uploaded a "cut" version to see inside the bottle. That one is for education purpose, and also to prove that I didn't "cheated".Bezier library: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2170645NOTE: The library is quite small, I uploaded it with the model for simplicity.[2017-03-13] This model doesn't print well. I need to adjust the wall thickness and flatten the bottom. I will upload a version 2 very soon.[2017-03-14] Uploaded v2 - Updated version of the library bezier.scad, thicker walls and flat bottom. The bottle body is now entirely made with bezier. I also fixed the "2-manifold" warning which was due to floating point noise. If you prefer the round bottom (as it was before), you can edit the file klein-bottle_v2.scad and change bottleBezier(true); to bottleBezier(false); in module bottle(). Hopefully it will be easier to print with these adjustments.[2017-03-18] Today, I started experimenting with Slic3r. I discovered that my "floating point" correction was good to get rid of OpenSCAD warning, but made my STL unusable in Slic3r. I tried to use to "Fix STL file" function in Slic3r but it made it worse. I re-generated my version 2 without the floating point correction, and now it works nicely in Slic3r. Having a warning in OpenSCAD is better than having a STL file that can't be printed.
